	about: `TL;DR I'm an easy-to-work with, passionate, hard-working software engineer.<br>
		...I enjoy other stuff too.(See 'hobbies')<br><br>
		I'm a passionate problem solver and have an entrepreneurial
 		spirit for creating anything that can help someone.
		I take my quality of work seriously, but try not to take my work too seriously.
  	I think clean and easy to reason about code is just plain beautiful.
  	I'm passionate about clarity and brevity in process and I enjoy improving documentation wherever I can.
  	If I'm not making it easier for whoever comes after me, then I'm doing it wrong.
  	I have a small ego and a big heart, with a love for helping others, which I had the privilege of doing in my last line of work.(See 'workHistory')
  	I love teamwork and thrive in its environment. But I also enjoy working alone because it allows me to put my head down to truck through whatever I'm working on.
  	I'm a self starter and I'm always looking to improve things where I can. (This is what drove most of the apps I've worked on.)<br><br>`,
